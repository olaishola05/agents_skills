# write-a-skill

Create new agent skills with proper structure and bundled resources.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask user about:
- What task/domain does the skill cover?
- What specific use cases should it handle?
- Does it need executable scripts or just instructions?
- Any reference materials to include?

### Step 2: Draft the Skill

Create:
- `SKILL.md` with concise instructions
- `REFERENCE.md` if content exceeds 500 lines
- `EXAMPLES.md` for usage examples
- `scripts/` folder if deterministic operations needed

### Step 3: Review with User

Present draft and ask:
- Does this cover your use cases?
- Anything missing or unclear?
- Should any section be more/less detailed?

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── REFERENCE.md       # Detailed docs (if needed)
├── EXAMPLES.md        # Usage examples (if needed)
└── scripts/           # Utility scripts (if needed)
    └── helper.js
```

## SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of capability. Use when [specific triggers].
---

# Skill Name

## Quick start

[Minimal working example]

## Workflows

[Step-by-step processes with checklists for complex tasks]

## Advanced features

[Link to separate files: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)]
```

## Description Requirements

The description is **the only thing the agent sees** when deciding which skill to load. It's surfaced in the system prompt alongside all installed skills.

**Goal**: Give the agent just enough info to know:
1. What capability this skill provides
2. When/why to trigger it (specific keywords, contexts, file types)

**Format**:
- Max 1024 chars
- Write in third person
- First sentence: what it does
- Second sentence: "Use when [specific triggers]"

**Good example**:
```
Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

**Bad example**:
```
Helps with documents.
```

## When to Add Scripts

Add utility scripts when:
- Operation is deterministic (validation, formatting)
- Same code would be generated repeatedly
- Errors need explicit handling

## When to Split Files

Split into separate files when:
- SKILL.md exceeds 100 lines
- Content has distinct domains
- Advanced features are rarely needed

## Review Checklist

After drafting, verify:
- [ ] Description includes triggers ("Use when...")
- [ ] SKILL.md under 100 lines
- [ ] No time-sensitive info
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Concrete examples included
- [ ] References one level deep
