# /smell — Code smell review

You are running a 5-step code-smell review. Follow the steps **in order**. Do not skip any. Do not invent findings. Cite catalog IDs verbatim from the lists below.

---

## Step 1 — Ingest

The diff below has already been collected. Read it carefully before proceeding. It contains both the committed changes vs the base (3-dot `base...HEAD`) **and** the working-tree changes (staged + unstaged).

!`bash -c '
BASE="$1"
if [ -z "$BASE" ]; then
  BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed "s@^refs/remotes/@@")
  [ -z "$BASE" ] && BASE="origin/main"
  git rev-parse "$BASE" >/dev/null 2>&1 || BASE="main"
fi
if ! git rev-parse "$BASE" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ERROR: base $BASE not found. Pass an explicit branch: /smell <branch>"
  exit 1
fi
echo "===== BASE: $BASE ====="
echo
echo "----- Stat (committed vs $BASE) -----"
git diff --stat "$BASE"...HEAD || true
echo
echo "----- Stat (working tree, staged+unstaged) -----"
git diff --stat HEAD || true
echo
echo "===== Committed diff (vs $BASE, -U10) ====="
git diff -U10 "$BASE"...HEAD || true
echo
echo "===== Working-tree diff (staged + unstaged, -U10) ====="
git diff -U10 HEAD || true
' -- "$ARGUMENTS"`

## Step 2 — Classify

Pick **exactly one** category for the overall change and justify in **one sentence**:

- `feature` — new user-visible behavior, endpoints, UI, or capability
- `refactor` — internal restructure, no behavior change
- `bugfix` — corrects incorrect behavior
- `test` — tests-only
- `docs` — docs/comments only
- `config` — config / build / infra only
- `mixed` — multiple of the above; name the dominant one

---

## Step 3 — Weight the lens

Decide whether to emphasize **Clean Code**, **Gang of Four**, or **Mixed**. State your choice and a one-sentence rationale.

Heuristic:
- Diff introduces new classes / hierarchies / abstractions / extension points → **Gang of Four lens**.
- Diff is mostly inline edits, naming, function shape, duplication → **Clean Code lens**.
- Both → **Mixed**.

### Clean Code reminder (Robert C. Martin, 2008)
- **Functions**: small, do one thing, one level of abstraction (G34), ≤3 args (F1), no boolean flag args (F3), no output args (F2).
- **Names**: reveal intent (N1), unambiguous (N4), longer for longer scopes (N5), describe side effects (N7).
- **Comments**: explain *why* not *what*; delete obsolete (C2), redundant (C3), commented-out (C5).
- **General**: duplication is the worst smell (G5); polymorphism over switch (G23); encapsulate conditionals (G28); avoid Law-of-Demeter violations (G36); replace magic numbers with named constants (G25).
- **Tests**: F.I.R.S.T. — Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely; test boundary conditions (T5).

### Gang of Four reminder (Gamma/Helm/Johnson/Vlissides, 1994; design smells from Martin)
- **23 patterns** in three groups:
  - **Creational**: Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, Singleton.
  - **Structural**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.
  - **Behavioral**: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor.
- **Two core rules**: *program to an interface, not an implementation*; *favor object composition over class inheritance*.
- **SOLID**: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP.
- **Seven design smells (Martin)**: rigidity, fragility, immobility, viscosity, needless complexity, needless repetition, opacity.
- **Pattern-missing signals** (most useful as scanner heuristics):
  - Long if/elif/match on a type-code or enum repeated across methods → **Strategy** or **State**.
  - Client directly instantiates concrete classes from a hierarchy → **Factory Method** or **Abstract Factory**.
  - Subclass explosion combining orthogonal traits (`RedBoldButton`, `BlueBoldButton`…) → **Decorator** or **Bridge**.
  - Polling another object for state changes; hand-rolled listener loops → **Observer**.
  - Two near-identical methods differing in 1–2 steps → **Template Method**.
  - Recursive container handled with `isinstance(x, list)` branches → **Composite**.
  - Inline call-translation to a foreign API surface → **Adapter**.
  - Ad-hoc tuples/dicts representing deferred actions, ad-hoc undo stacks → **Command**.
  - Index-based traversal of a custom collection (`for i in range(c.size())`) → **Iterator**.
  - Clients reach into many internals of one subsystem → **Facade**.

## Step 4 — Analyze

Walk every hunk. For each issue you find, cite **exactly one** catalog ID from the lists below. Quote the smallest possible code excerpt. One-sentence *why*. One-sentence *fix*. Don't invent IDs that aren't in this list.

### Clean Code IDs (language-agnostic)
- **CC.C1** Inappropriate Information (non-technical info in comments)
- **CC.C2** Obsolete Comment (doesn't match the code)
- **CC.C3** Redundant Comment (restates what the code says)
- **CC.C5** Commented-Out Code
- **CC.F1** Too Many Arguments (>3)
- **CC.F2** Output Arguments (params mutated as outputs)
- **CC.F
